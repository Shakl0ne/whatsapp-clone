# whatsapp-clone
This is a quick and simple web application that allows users to sign in and make conversations with other users on localhost (I have no intentions to publish this app yet).

Here are steps on how to make it work:
1. Download the git repo.
2. cd into server, npm start
3. cd into client, npm start
4. you can register mutilple users via incognito window, add contract to each other, and start chatting!
